# accession-numbers

Machine-readable regular expressions for identifying accession numbers for cultural heritage organizations in text.

## Important

This is work in progress. Things are starting to settle down but may still change.

## Motivation

The goal of this package is to have a collection of machine-readable regular expression patterns that can be used by applications to isolate accession numbers in arbitrary bodies of text. For example these data might be used by the [sfomuseum/ios-label-whisperer](https://github.com/sfomuseum/ios-label-whisperer) application.

## Data

Data for individual organizations are defined in [`data/{organization}.json`](data) files. These files conform the JSON schema (draft/2020-12) defined in the [schema](schema) folder.

The simplest version of a data file consists of `name` and `url` properties identifying an organization and a `patterns` properties which contains one or more dictionaries containing regular expression patterns that can be used to isolate accession numbers in a body of text. For example:

```
{
    "organization_name": "National Air and Space Museum",
    "organization_url": "https://airandspace.si.edu/",
    "patterns": [
	{
	    "label": "common",
	    "pattern": "((?:\\D)(?:\\d{4})(?:\\d)+)",
	    "tests": {
		"A19610048000": [
		    "A19610048000"
		],
		"A19670093000": [
		    "A19670093000"
		],
		"A19920072000": [
		    "A19920072000"
		],
		"A19670176000": [
		    "A19670176000"
		]
	    }
	}
    ]
}
```

Here is a complete example, containing all the possible properties defined in the schema:

```
{
    "organization_name": "SFO Museum",
    "organization_url": "https://sfomuseum.org/",
    "iiif_manifest": "https://millsfield.sfomuseum.org/objects/{accession_number}/manifest",
    "oembed_profile": "https://millsfield.sfomuseum.org/oembed/?url=https://millsfield.sfomuseum.org/objects/{accession_number}&format=json",
    "object_url": "https://millsfield.sfomuseum.org/objects/{accession_number}",
    "whosonfirst_id": 102527513,    
    "patterns": [
	{
	    "label": "common",
	    "pattern": "((?:L|R)?(?:\\d+)\\.(?:\\d+)\\.(?:\\d+)(?:\\.(?:\\d+))?(?:(?:\\s?[sa-z])+)?)",
	    "tests": {
		"1994.18.175": [
		    "1994.18.175"
		],
		"R2021.0501.030": [
		    "R2021.0501.030"		    
		],
		"2014.120.001": [
		    "2014.120.001"		    
		],
		"2001.106.041 a": [
		    "2001.106.041 a"
		],
		"L2021.0501.033 a": [
		    "L2021.0501.033 a"
		],
		"2002.135.017.042": [
		    "2002.135.017.042"
		],
		"2000.058.1185 a c": [
		    "2000.058.1185 a c"
		],		
		"1994.18.199a": [
		    "1994.18.199a"
		],
		"This is an object\\nGift of Important Donor\\n1994.18.175\\n\\nThis is another object\\nAnonymouts Gift\\n1994.18.165 1994.18.199a\\n2000.058.1185 a c\\nOil on canvas": [
		    "1994.18.175",
		    "1994.18.165",
		    "1994.18.199a",
		    "2000.058.1185 a c"
		]
	    }
	}
    ]
}
```

### Patterns

Regular expression patterns should match the entire accession number and any interior matches should be non-greedy.

### Tests

Tests for any given pattern are defined as a dictionary whose values are strings to match against (the current pattern) and whose values are an array of expected matches for a corresponding string (key). Tests with empty "matches" arrays are skipped.

_Tests are run using the [cmd/test-runner](cmd/test-runner]) tool which is written in Go and uses the [regexp.FindStringSubmatch](https://pkg.go.dev/regexp#Regexp.FindStringSubmatch) method to find matches._

## Tests

This packages comes with a command-line tool for running tests against some or all the files in the `data` directory. The tool is called `test-runner` and its source code can be found in the [cmd/test-runner](cmd/test-runner) folder. It has also been pre-compiled to run on Windows, Linux and Mac OS computers. These binary versions are kept in the `bin/(YOUR-OS-HERE)` folders. Possible values for `(YOUR-OS-HERE)` are:

| Operating System | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Linux | linux |
| Mac OS | darwin |
| Windows | windows |

To run the `test-runner` tool type the following from a terminal window:

```
$> bin/(YOUR-OS-HERE)/test-runner data/*.json
```

And you should see something like this:

```
$> ./bin/darwin/test-runner data/*.json
2021/11/14 15:38:21 All tests pass for Cooper Hewitt Smithsonian National Design Museum
2021/11/14 15:38:21 All tests pass for SFO Museum
```

If you have the `make` application installed on your computer you can also simply run the `tests` Makefile target. For example:

```
$> make tests
bin/darwin/test-runner data/*.json
2021/11/14 16:19:59 All tests pass for Art Institute of Chicago
2021/11/14 16:19:59 All tests pass for Cooper Hewitt Smithsonian National Design Museum
2021/11/14 16:19:59 All tests pass for Denver Museum of Nature & Science
2021/11/14 16:19:59 All tests pass for Getty Center

2021/11/14 16:19:59 All tests pass for Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History
2021/11/14 16:19:59 All tests pass for SFO Museum
```
